# UoG-Coursework
University of Guelph Coursework Showcase

A general showcase of some code work done within some of the courses I took at the University of Guelph.  
These were uploaded almost as-is from submission, so little extra polisihing has been done, aside from minor work with the CIS*2430 dayplanner package rename.
