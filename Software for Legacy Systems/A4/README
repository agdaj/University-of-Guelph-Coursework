Compiling and Running eightQueens
*********************************
The zip file contains the Ada, C, and Fortran implementations of eightQall.pas, as well
as a Makefile that compiles the programs, and a Python script to allow easy running of
the programs.

As given in the Makefile, the Python script likely requires chmod 755 eightQueens.py, and python3
is used as its interpreter. Ideally, the Makefile will run all the compilation steps and a chmod 755
command on the python script once the programs are compiled, just by typing in 'make'.
